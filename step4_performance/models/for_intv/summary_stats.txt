Quantiles, specifically the first and third quantiles, which correspond to the 25th and 75th percentiles.
Median, the mid-point in the distribution, which also corresponds to the 50th percentile.
Interquartile range (IQR), the width between the third and first quantiles. Expressed mathematically, we have IQR = Q3 — Q1.
Min, minimum value in the dataset excluding outliers, which corresponds to Q1–1.5xIQR.
Max, maximum value in the dataset, excluding outliers, which corresponds to Q3+ 1.5xIQR.
